  <li>If you choose manually, you have to type the dataset manually.</li>
  <li>If you choose uploading the dataset, you have to give the path of the dataset (I have given a sample csv file for easy working) .</li>
  <li>After giving the location of the dataset, it will ask you to speak your current location and destination location.</li>
  <li>Then it will route the shortest path using Dijkstra algorithm.</li>
